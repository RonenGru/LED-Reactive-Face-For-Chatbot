**Reactive Face: A 256-LED Matrix Animation**

**Overview**
--------

The Reactive Face project is an innovative display that combines animation and interactivity. This open-source project features a 16x16 LED matrix, consisting of 256 LEDs, which can be controlled to create a simple yet engaging face.

**Description**
------------

In this implementation, the face responds to audio inputs by moving its mouth and blinking its eyes. The mouth movement is triggered by sound waves, creating a basic form of expression.

**Features**

* 256-LED matrix display
* Reactive mouth animation triggered by audio input (using ESP32's)
* Eye blinking effect

**Components**
-------------

    • Two ESP32 microcontrollers
    • A 16x16 LED Pixel Panel
    • 2 solderable breadboards
    • An INMP441 Omnidirectional Microphone
    • A rocker switch
    • A DC jack
    • A Max98357 I2S 3W Amplifier Breakout Interface Module
    • A 3W 8Ohm micro speaker
    • A 5V 2A power supply adapter
    • Various jumper cables and screws
    • A 3D printed box
